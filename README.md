HTML Structure
DOCTYPE and Head Section:

The document begins with <!DOCTYPE html>, indicating it’s an HTML5 document.
The <head> section includes meta tags for character encoding and responsive design, a link to Material Symbols for icons, and a title for the webpage.
Body Content:

The body consists of a container with a left sidebar, main content area, and a right sidebar.
Left Sidebar
Contains the bank's name and a navigation menu with links to different sections such as Home, Accounts, Transactions, Transfer Funds, Loan Services, Settings, and Logout.
Main Content Area
Welcome Message: A personalized greeting for the user.
Function Buttons: Buttons that trigger different modals for functionalities like managing funds, bill payments, applying for loans, etc.
Modals: Several modal popups that provide functionality for depositing, withdrawing, bill payments, loan applications, and managing credit cards.
Right Sidebar
Displays user profile information, including a profile picture, name, account type, and current balance.
A section for recent updates, which will be populated dynamically.
JavaScript Functionality
Event Listeners:

The script waits for the DOM to load before executing.
Event listeners are added to buttons for opening and closing modals, as well as for handling deposits and withdrawals.
Managing Transactions:

Deposit and Withdrawal: The buttons update the current balance based on user input, ensuring valid amounts are entered. If the operation is successful, the balance is updated, and a transaction record is added to the history table.
Transaction History: New transactions are dynamically appended to a table that records the date, type, and amount of each transaction.
User Feedback:

Alerts are provided for invalid input (e.g., withdrawing more than the current balance).
Recent updates are displayed in a list, showing transaction messages with timestamps.
Modal Functionality:

Modals are shown and hidden based on user interactions. Clicking outside a modal also closes it, enhancing usability.
Styling (Not Shown)
While the HTML structure doesn’t include CSS, it’s assumed that the linked Bank.css file would provide styles for layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
